turnaround time = time for completion


You should report these when each process exits, but also keep track of them so that you can calculate the average turnaround and response times for a set of processes when the execute command finishes.
You will also need to perform a CPU Utilization calculation. This calculation is the percentage of time that the CPU is active (has a PCB in it). To be clear, if there is nothing for the CPU to do (all current processes are blocked, waiting for events), then the CPU is not being utilized. The result of this calculation should be output when the execute function finishes running.
